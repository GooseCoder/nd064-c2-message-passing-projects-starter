The Api Gateway serves as an access point to the rest of the services so no gRPC are exposed to the end user api

Endpoints that interact with gRPC internally:
POST http://localhost:30001/api/persons
{
    "first_name": "example_name",
    "last_name": "example_last_name",
    "company_name": "example_company"
}

GET http://localhost:30001/api/persons
GET http://localhost:30001/api/persons/5
GET http://localhost:30001/api/persons/5/connection
